How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Pbcchain-Qt` (on Mac)
or `pbcchaind`/`pbcchain-qt` (on Linux).
